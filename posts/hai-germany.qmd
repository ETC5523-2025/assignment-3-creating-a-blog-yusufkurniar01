## Problem description

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) occur during a patient's hospital treatment. They keep people in hospital longer, add costs, and in severe cases can be fatal. In Germany, even with a mid-range infection rate, the overall impact is significant because so many people are admitted: about 480,000 infections, around 16,000 deaths, and roughly 250,000 healthy life-years lost **in 2011**. The key takeaway is to maintain strong universal hygiene and focus prevention efforts on the highest-risk areas, particularly pneumonia and bloodstream infections.

## Data description

This post uses estimates for Germany from the ECDC 2011–2012 point-prevalence study, calculated using the BHAI method. The study reports infections, deaths attributable to infection, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), where one DALY equals one healthy year of life lost. @tbl-hai-counts lists the headline values used in this section.

Numbers are taken directly from the published estimates, and no re-modelling was done. Only light formatting was applied for readability (thousand separators). Methods and interpretation follow @Zacher2019 and @Gastmeier2010.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hai-counts 
#| tbl-cap: "Key HAI metrics for Germany (2011) used in this post." 
library(tibble) 
library(dplyr) 
library(knitr)
library(gt)

metrics <- tribble( ~metric, ~value, 
                    "Estimated infections (all types)", 478222, 
                    "Attributable deaths (all types)", 16245, 
                    "DALYs (all types)", 248920 )

## Analysis

Source. Estimates are from the ECDC 2011–2012 point-prevalence study, using the BHAI method (@Zacher2019; @Gastmeier2010). Values shown are the study’s central estimates for Germany in 2011.

### Which infections are most frequent?

Urinary tract infections have the highest case counts, followed by pneumonia and surgical-site infections (Zacher et al., 2019). See @fig-hai-bar.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hai-bar
#| fig-cap: "Estimated cases by infection type (subset used in this post)."
#| fig-alt: "Bar chart for Germany 2011 showing UTI highest, then pneumonia, then surgical-site infections."
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

by_type <- tibble::tribble(
  ~type,            ~estimated_cases,
  "UTI",            214150,
  "Pneumonia",      106586,
  "Surgical site",   93222
)

#order from top to bottom
by_type$type <- factor(by_type$type, levels = c("UTI","Pneumonia","Surgical site"))

ggplot(by_type, aes(type, estimated_cases)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(estimated_cases)), vjust = -0.3, size = 3.6) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Estimated cases (2011)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

```

### Do the most common infections cause the most harm?

No. Pneumonia and bloodstream infections account for a larger share of deaths and DALYs than their raw counts suggest (@Zacher2019). This supports prevention that targets not only common infections but also severe pathways.

@tbl-hai-counts summarises the national totals (infections, attributable deaths, DALYs), while @fig-hai-bar highlights frequency for quick comparison.

### Why these displays?

- @tbl-hai-counts displays the three headline metrics together, with thousand separators for easy quick scanning.

- @fig-hai-bar uses a short, labelled bar chart so that the rank order of infection types can be read at a glance without hovering or decoding the legends.

### Link back to the question

The question asked, “How big is the burden of hospital infections in Germany?”
In **2011**, Germany recorded about 480,000 infections, 16,000 deaths, and 250,000 healthy life-years lost (@tbl-hai-counts). UTIs were the most common (@fig-hai-bar), but pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused the most severe outcomes. This highlights the need for robust universal hygiene and targeted prevention measures in high-risk areas.

## Conclusion

Germany’s burden from hospital-acquired infections was substantial in 2011: around 480,000 infections, 16,000 deaths, and 250,000 healthy life-years lost (@tbl-hai-counts; @fig-hai-bar). UTIs are frequent, but pneumonia and bloodstream infections drive the most harm. These findings are consistent with BHAI estimates and clinical work (@Zacher2019; @Gastmeier2010). The practical message is clear: maintain robust universal hygiene and prioritise high-severity prevention bundles (e.g., ventilator-associated pneumonia and central-line care).
