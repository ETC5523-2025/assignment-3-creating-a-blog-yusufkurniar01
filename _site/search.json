No. Pneumonia and bloodstream infections contribute a larger share of deaths and DALYs than their counts alone would suggest Zacher et al. (2019).

    "text": "Conclusion\nGermany recorded hundreds of thousands of HAIs in 2011. UTIs were frequent, but pneumonia and bloodstream infections drove severe outcomes. The implication for practice is to maintain universal hygiene and target high-severity pathways such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and line care bundles."
