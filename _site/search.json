See Figure Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Estimated cases by infection type (subset used in this post).\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the most common infections cause the most harm? No. Pneumonia and bloodstream infections contribute a larger share of deaths and DALYs than their counts alone would suggest Zacher et al. (2019). Prevention should prioritise high-severity pathways.\nTable 1 summarises the totals cited in the problem and Figure 1 focuses on frequency for communication clarity."

    "text": "Conclusion\nGermany recorded hundreds of thousands of HAIs in 2011. UTIs were frequent, but pneumonia and bloodstream infections drove severe outcomes. The implication for practice is to maintain universal hygiene and target high-severity pathways such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and line care bundles."
